=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kathara list` [`-h`] [`-a`] [`-l`] [`-n` <DEVICE_NAME>]  


## DESCRIPTION

The following information are displayed:

* `LAB_HASH`: autogenerated hash associated with a network scenario
* `DEVICE_NAME`: name of the device
* `STATUS`: status of the device 
* `CPU %`: the percentage of the host's CPU the device is using
* `MEM USAGE / LIMIT`: the total memory the device is using, and the total amount of memory it is allowed to use
* `MEM %`: the percentage of the host's memory the device is using
* `NET I/O`: the amount of data the device has sent and received over its network interfaces

## OPTIONS

* `-h`, `--help`:
    Show an help message and exit.

* `-a`, `--all`:
    Show all running Kathara devices of all users. MUST BE ROOT FOR THIS OPTION.

    This option can be run only by `root` user.

* `-l`, `--live`:
    Live mode, can be used only when a network scenario is launched.

    Show exhaustive live status of each device of the current network scenario. Can only be used when after the network scenario is started. This overrides the default behavior of the command described above.

        + `MEM USAGE / LIMIT`: the total memory the device is using, and the total amount of memory it is allowed to use
        + `MEM %`: the percentage of the host's memory the device is using
        + `NET I/O`: the amount of data the device has sent and received over its network interfaces

    To quit the live screen, pass the `SIGINT` `signal`(7) to the process (usually CTRL+C).
