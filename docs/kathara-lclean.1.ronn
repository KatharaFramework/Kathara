`kathara lclean` [`-h`] [`-d` <DIRECTORY>] [<DEVICE_NAME> [<DEVICE_NAME> ...]]  

## DESCRIPTION

Gracefully shut down a running network scenario.
By default, stops all the devices of the network scenario. If a list of <DEVICE_NAME>s is provided, then only devices with a matching name and that are part of the network scenario will be halted. 

## OPTIONS

    Show an help message and exit.

* `-d` <DIRECTORY>, `--directory` <DIRECTORY>:
	Specify the folder containing the network scenario.

	Cleans the Kathara network scenario that is located inside <DIRECTORY>.
