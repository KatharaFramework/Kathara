kathara(1) -- A network emulation tool
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kathara` [`-h`] [`-v`] <command> [<args>]

## DESCRIPTION

Kathara is a network emulation tool.

It is an implementation of the notorious [Netkit](https://github.com/maxonthegit/netkit-core) using Python.  
Ten times faster than Netkit and more than 100 times lighter, the framework has the performances to run in production.

Within the Kathara environment each network device, called device, is implemented by a container, and each interconnection link is emulated by using a virtual network.

Each device can be configured to have an arbitrary number of (virtual) network interfaces.

By default, devices use a Docker Image which includes network oriented software such as routing daemons (RIP, OSPF, etc.), an HTTP server, firewalling utilities (`iptables`(8)), and diagnostic tools (`ping`(1), `traceroute`(1), `tcpdump`(1), etc.).  
By configuring the appropriate software, it is possible to emulate with a device a specific network device (e.g., a router).  
Other applications (such as SDN and P4) can be added using custom Docker Images.

Kathara provides two alternative interfaces to start and configure devices. A set of `v`-prefixed commands (vstart, vclean, vconfig), that allow to start and manage single devices while providing finegrained control on their configuration; and a set of `l`-prefixed commands (lstart, lclean, linfo, lrestart, ltest), that ease setting up preconfigured network laboratories consisting of several devices.

Kathara also provides a set of global commands (connect, info, wipe, settings, check).

## FILES

Kathara stores its default configuration settings inside a file named `kathara.conf`. This file is placed in the `~/.config` folder. If it does not exist when Kathara is launched, it will be created with default settings. See `kathara.conf`(5) for information about the location of this file and for a description of its format.
