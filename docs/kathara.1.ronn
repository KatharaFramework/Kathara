kathara(1) -- A network emulation tool
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kathara` [`-h`] [`-v`] <command> [<args>]  

## DESCRIPTION

Kathara is a network emulation tool based on Docker containers. The tool can be really helpful in showing interactive demos/lessons, testing production networks in a sandbox environment, or developing new network protocols.

Kathara is the spiritual successor of the notorious [Netkit](https://github.com/maxonthegit/netkit-core), hence it is cross-compatible, and inherits its language and features.

Within the Kathara environment each network device, called device, is implemented by a container, and each interconnection link is emulated by using a virtual network.

Each device can be configured to have an arbitrary number of (virtual) network interfaces.

By default, devices use a Docker Image which includes network oriented software such as routing daemons (RIP, OSPF, etc.), an HTTP server, firewalling utilities (`iptables`(8)), and diagnostic tools (`ping`(1), `traceroute`(1), `tcpdump`(1), etc.).  
By configuring the appropriate software, it is possible to faithfully emulate a specific network device (e.g., a router).  

Kathara provides two alternative interfaces to start and configure devices. A set of `v`-prefixed commands (vstart, vclean, vconfig), that allow to start and manage single devices while providing finegrained control on their configuration; and a set of `l`-prefixed commands (lstart, lclean, linfo, lrestart, lconfig), that ease setting up preconfigured network scenarios consisting of several devices.

Kathara also provides a set of global commands (connect, info, wipe, settings, check).

## KATHARA COMMANDS

The possible kathara commands are:

* `kathara-vstart`(1):
    Start a new Kathara device

* `kathara-vclean`(1):
    Stop a single Kathara device

* `kathara-vconfig`(1):
    Manage the network interfaces of a running Kathara device

* `kathara-lstart`(1):
    Start a Kathara network scenario

* `kathara-lclean`(1):
    Stop a Kathara network scenario

* `kathara-linfo`(1):
    Show information about a Kathara network scenario

* `kathara-lrestart`(1):
    Restart a Kathara network scenario

* `kathara-lconfig`(1):
    Manage the network interfaces of a running Kathara device in a network scenario

* `kathara-connect`(1):
    Connect to a Kathara device

* `kathara-exec`(1):
    Execute a command in a Kathara device

* `kathara-wipe`(1):
    Delete all Kathara devices and collision domains, optionally also delete settings

* `kathara-list`(1):

* `kathara-settings`(1):
    Show and edit settings

* `kathara-check`(1):

## FILES

Kathara stores its default configuration settings inside a file named `kathara.conf`. This file is placed in the `~/.config` folder. If it does not exist when Kathara is launched, it will be created with default settings. See `kathara.conf`(5) for information about the location of this file and for a description of its format.
