# Docker-in-Docker

This recipe lets you run Docker within Docker.

There is only one requirement: your Docker version should support the
`--privileged` flag.


## A word of warning

If you came here because you would like to run a testing system like
Jenkins in a container, and want that container to spin up more containers,
then please read this [blog post](
http://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/)
first. Thank you!


## Another word of warning

This work is now obsolete, thanks to the [combined](
https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/15596) [efforts](
https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/docker)
of some amazing people like @jfrazelle and @tianon, who also 
are black belts in the art of putting IKEA furniture together.

If you want to run Docker-in-Docker today, all you need to do is:

```bash
docker run --privileged -d docker:dind
```

... And that's it; you get Docker running in Docker, thanks to
the official Docker image, in its "Docker-in-Docker" flavor.
You can then connect to this Docker instance by starting
another Docker container linking to the first one (which is
a pretty amazing thing to do).

For more details about the `docker:dind` official image,
explanations about how to use it, customize it to use
specific storage drivers, and other tidbits of useful
knowledge, check [its documentation on the Docker Hub](
https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/).


## If you read past this paragraph ...

... Then you're probably an archaeologist, a masochist, or both.

Seriously, though: the information below is here mostly
for historical value, or if you want to understand how those
things work under the hood.

You've been warned!


## Quickstart

Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t dind .
```

Run Docker-in-Docker and get a shell where you can play, and docker daemon logs
to stdout:
```bash
docker run --privileged -t -i dind
```

Run Docker-in-Docker and get a shell where you can play, but docker daemon logs
into `/var/log/docker.log`:
```bash
docker run --privileged -t -i -e LOG=file dind
```

Run Docker-in-Docker and expose the inside Docker to the outside world:
```bash
docker run --privileged -d -p 4444 -e PORT=4444 dind
```

Note: when started with the `PORT` environment variable, the image will just
the Docker daemon and expose it over said port. When started *without* the
`PORT` environment variable, the image will run the Docker daemon in the
background and execute a shell for you to play.

### Daemon configuration

You can use the `DOCKER_DAEMON_ARGS` environment variable to configure the
docker daemon with any extra options:
```bash
docker run --privileged -d -e DOCKER_DAEMON_ARGS="-D" dind
```

## It didn't work!

If you get a weird permission message, check the output of `dmesg`: it could
be caused by AppArmor. In that case, try again, adding an extra flag to
kick AppArmor out of the equation:

```bash
docker run --privileged --lxc-conf="lxc.aa_profile=unconfined" -t -i dind
```

If you get the warning:

````
WARNING: the 'devices' cgroup should be in its own hierarchy.
````

When starting up dind, you can get around this by shutting down docker and running:

````
# /etc/init.d/lxc stop
# umount /sys/fs/cgroup/
# mount -t cgroup devices 1 /sys/fs/cgroup
````

If the unmount fails, you can find out the proper mount-point with:

````
$ cat /proc/mounts | grep cgroup
````

## How It Works

The main trick is to have the `--privileged` flag. Then, there are a few things
to care about:

- cgroups pseudo-filesystems have to be mounted, and they have to be mounted
  with the same hierarchies than the parent environment; this is done by a
  wrapper script, which is setup to run by default;
- `/var/lib/docker` cannot be on AUFS, so we make it a volume.

That's it.


## Important Warning About Disk Usage

Since AUFS cannot use an AUFS mount as a branch, it means that we have to
use a volume. Therefore, all inner Docker data (images, containers, etc.)
will be in the volume. Remember: volumes are not cleaned up when you
`docker rm`, so if you wonder where did your disk space go after nesting
10 Dockers within each other, look no further :-)


## Which Version Of Docker Does It Run?

Outside: it will use your installed version.

Inside: the Dockerfile will retrieve the latest `docker` binary from
https://get.docker.io/; so if you want to include *your* own `docker`
build, you will have to edit it. If you want to always use your local
version, you could change the `ADD` line to be e.g.:

    ADD /usr/bin/docker /usr/local/bin/docker


## Can I Run Docker-in-Docker-in-Docker?

Yes. Note, however, that there seems to be a weird FD leakage issue.
To work around it, the `wrapdocker` script carefully closes all the
file descriptors inherited from the parent Docker and `lxc-start`
(except stdio). I'm mentioning this in case you were relying on
those inherited file descriptors, or if you're trying to repeat
the experiment at home.

[kojiromike/inception](https://github.com/kojiromike/inception) is
a wrapper script that uses dind to nest Docker to arbitrary depth.

Also, when you will be exiting a nested Docker, this will happen:

```bash
root@975423921ac5:/# exit
root@6b2ae8bf2f10:/# exit
root@419a67dfdf27:/# exit
root@bc9f450caf22:/# exit
jpetazzo@tarrasque:~/Work/DOTCLOUD/dind$
```

At that point, you should blast Hans Zimmer's [Dream Is Collapsing](
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imamcajBEJs) on your loudspeakers while twirling
a spinning top.
