# Compiling Kathara for Mac OSX (Unsigned)

1. Install `pkgbuild`, `productbuild` and `make` from Apple developer repository
    - If you have `XCode` installed you probably already have them installed
    - Otherwise, download them from [here](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action)
2. Change the Kathara version number in both `src/Kathara/version.py` and `Makefile` files.
3. Run `make all_x86` or `make all_arm64` to automatically compile and create the package for the desired architecture.
You can compile the `x86` package on a Mac with Intel CPU, and the `arm64` on a Mac with Apple CPU.
    - Run `make deps` to automatically download and install dependencies for your architecture
    - Run `make binary_x86_64` or `make binary_arm64` to automatically compile the package
    - Run `make createInstaller_x86_64` or `make createInstaller_arm64` to create package
    - Run `make clean` to clean all intermediate files
4. Share the Kathara pkg in `Output` folder :)
